Woodentrack is a coffeescript library for designing and testing toy train track layouts.

It has as few dependencies, as shown in package.json.  run "npm install" to set them up.

## Notes

The goals of this branch are to
1. create a model that's independent of the painting toolkit (e.g. d3 or raphael)
2. have some tests
3. try out coffeescript
4. all the goals of the master project
